This is the github repository for a Junction 2021 project. \
This task is for the company Miro \
Our solution was to create an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project where the user can take a picture of a document, piece of paper, a whiteboard that was written on in the real world. This photo has the OCR transfer all data into the whiteboard. Enjoy! \
